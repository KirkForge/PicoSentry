# Changelog

All notable changes to PicoSentry will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Unified 4 previously separate packages into one CLI**: `picosentry`, `picodome`, `picowatch`, `picoshogun` are now subcommands of a single `picosentry` package.
- Vendored `pico-core` dependency directly into `picosentry._core` to eliminate install friction (#3).
- Single `picosentry` PyPI project now supersedes the previous individual packages. Old versions (0.16.0, 1.0.0, 1.0.1) remain installable; new installs default to 2.0.0.
- GitHub repository consolidated at [`KirkForge/PicoSentry`](https://github.com/KirkForge/PicoSentry). Old `picosentry` PyPI namespace links to the same repo.

### Added
- `picosentry scan` — supply-chain scanner for npm, PyPI, Go, Cargo, Maven, RubyGems, NuGet.
- `picosentry sandbox` — seccomp-bpf runtime sandbox with behavioral analysis.
- `picosentry watch` — LLM prompt-injection detection and output validation.
- `picosentry serve` — API server, dashboard, and orchestration.
- Cross-layer correlation engine linking scan findings → sandbox behavior → watch alerts.
- Deterministic output guarantee: same inputs + same policy = same SHA-256.
- Optional extras: `[scan]`, `[watch-server]`, `[serve]`, `[otel]`, `[sigstore]`, `[all]` for granular dependency control.
- 49 ecosystem rules across 6 lockfile formats; 3,548 tests passing.

### Removed
- External `pico-core` dependency (now vendored).
- 4 separate PyPI projects (`picosentry` v1.x, `picodome`, `picowatch`, `picoshogun`) — see deprecation notice below.

### Quality
- Static analysis: `ruff` 358 → 0 errors, `mypy` 135 → 0 errors across 262 source files.
- 3 dead test files removed.
- 2 real bugs caught and fixed during cleanup: scheduler.py referenced an undefined variable in the `run` branch; maven_utils.py had a copy-paste bug in a version-text ternary.

## [1.x] — Individual packages (deprecated)

The 1.x line of `picosentry` and the related `picodome`, `picowatch`, `picoshogun` packages are now superseded by 2.0.0. They will not receive further updates. Install with `pip install picosentry>=2.0.0` to get the unified package.
